Whenever you need to show the enquiry button on a custom page or in a specific place of the page, you can rely on this shortcode:

<code>[wqoecf_button_quote]</code>

Make sure you enter the product’s ID with the parameter “product” to link the button to the right product in your WooCommerce. For example: <strong>[wqoecf_button_quote product="1234"]</strong> will let your users add product with ID 1234 to the cart.
